                <p>
                    The card game is a simple web-based game where cards are added to the sum one by one by clicking the
                    "Add Card" button until the sum is equal to or greater than 21. If the sum is equal to 21, the
                    player wins the game and 200 amounts are added to their total balance. If the sum is greater than
                    21, the player loses the game and 200 amounts are subtracted from their total balance. The game can
                    be restarted by clicking the "New Game" button.</p>

                    be incremented or decremented by clicking buttons. When the "Save" button is clicked, the current
